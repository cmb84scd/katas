# Katas

This is where I'm keeping all the Katas I've done since Makers. They are sorted by language and within that folder, each Kata is in a separate folder. I'm doing them using TDD, so storing them in this way makes it easier, especially as I have done quite a few now!

I have listed the Katas in the readme within each of the language folders. They can be accessed through the following links:

- [JavaScript](javascript/README.md)
- [Python](python/README.md)
- [Ruby](ruby/README.md)
