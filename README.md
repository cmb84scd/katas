# Katas

This is where I'm going to store all the Katas I've done since Makers. Each one is in a separate folder as I'm doing them the TDD way and it's easier to store them this way.

## Notes

I am aware I have added some exclusions to some of the rubocop.yml files. Normally I wouldn't do this but as these are Katas, I don't want to change them too much, hence why I am adding the odd exclusion. Otherwise, I am making sure they are linted as code standards are important to me.
