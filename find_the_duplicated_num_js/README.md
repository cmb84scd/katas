## Find The Duplicated Number in a Consecutive Unsorted List - Tougher Version

This is a Codewars 6kyu kata done in JavaScript.

### Task

Spin-off of this [kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/558dd9a1b3f79dc88e000001), here you will have to figure out an efficient strategy to solve the problem of finding the sole duplicate number among an unsorted array/list of numbers starting from 1 up to n.

Hints: a solution in linear time can be found; using the most intuitive ones to search for duplicates that can run in O(nÂ²) time won't work.
