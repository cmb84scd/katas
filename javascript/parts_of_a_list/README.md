## Parts of a list

This is a Codewars 7kyu kata done in JavaScript.

### Task

Write a function `partlist` that gives all the ways to divide a list (an array) of at least two elements into two non-empty parts.

- Each two non empty parts will be in a pair
- Each part will be in a string
- Elements of a pair must be in the same order as in the original array.

### Example:

```text
a = ["az", "toto", "picaro", "zone", "kiwi"] -->
[["az", "toto picaro zone kiwi"], ["az toto", "picaro zone kiwi"], ["az toto picaro", "zone kiwi"], ["az toto picaro zone", "kiwi"]]
```
