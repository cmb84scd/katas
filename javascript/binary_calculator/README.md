## Binary Calculator

This is a Codewars 7kyu kata done in JavaScript.

### Task

In this kata you need to write a function that will receive two strings (`n1` and `n2`), each representing an integer as a binary number. A third parameter will be provided (`o`) as a string representing one of the following operators: add, subtract, multiply.

Your task is to write the calculate function so that it will perform the arithmetic and the result returned should be a string representing the binary result.

Examples:

```text
1 + 1 === 10
10 + 10 === 100
```

Negative binary numbers are usually preceded by several 1's. For this kata, negative numbers can be represented with the negative symbol at the beginning of the string.

Examples of negatives:

```text
1 - 10 === -1
10 - 100 === -10
```
