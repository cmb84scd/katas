## Find Duplicates with String.match

This is a Codewars 7kyu kata done in Ruby.

### Task

One of your co-workers created a method called `num_duplicates`. This method takes in a string message and returns the number of duplicate words in the sentence.

However, you decided to write two test cases and found a bug! Oh no!

The first test case works fine, but the second one fails. Can you figure out what went wrong?

#### Notes

Some variable names have been adjusted slightly so that they conform to Ruby naming convention.
