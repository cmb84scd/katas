## Class conundrum - Bug Fixing 7

This is a Codewars 7kyu kata done in Ruby.

### Task

Oh no! Timmy's List Class has broken! Can you help timmy and fix his class? Timmy has a List class he has created, this is used for type strict arrays (which Timmy calls Lists).
When Timmy calls the Count property of the list it still remains at 0 when adding items.
Also it fails when Timmy trys to chain the adds e.g. `ruby my_list.add(0).add(1)`
