## Statistics Algorithm - Calculate mean

This is a Codewars 6kyu kata done in Ruby.

### Task

Create a mathematical algorithm to calculate the mean of a series of numbers. The mean of a series of numbers is the sum of all items in a set, divided by the number of items in that set.

Examples:

```text
calc_mean([]) should return 0
calc_mean([1, 2, 3]) should return 2.0
calc_mean([6, 8, 10]) should return 8.0
calc_mean([15, 30, 60, 120, 240]) should return 93.0
```

Inputs are always populated (non-empty) arrays. Input arrays never include non-integer or non-float elements. Non-array inputs return 0.
